# Hangman-Game
## For the most part, this is a classic Hangman game which goes by the disconcerting name "Who gettin hung?" All of the solutions to the game are names of characters in a blossoming literary world called Bramperverse. Thus, the irony of correctly guessing the solution to a game of "Who getting hung" is that the person will not be getting hung. Whether the player wins or loses, a modal appears at the end of the game and askes whether they want to "keep hangin" or not. The modal displays a different message if the player wins vs. if they lose, and in both cases it displays a blurb about the character who was the solution to the game. The blurbs are meant to be equivocal, and maybe even make the player scratch their head with regard to the role they played in the outcome of the game.

# Notes
## Non-alpha characters will not count as guesses
## Repeat guesses will not count against the player
## The structure of the page is super responsive, but because the game requires key-strokes it still will not work on most cell phone. (Key-pads won't open if no input fields).
